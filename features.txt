My Todo:
GET_CURRENT_THREAD: Get current threadid of the session
GET_THREAD_LIST: Get list of thread IDs for the session
INTERRUPT: Send an interrupt
GET_FILE_EXEC
FILE_SETFS
FILE_OPEN
FILE_PREAD Also does things with the timeline and trace readers. I need to figure out how this works.
FILE_CLOSE
SET_CONTINUE_THREAD
GET_IS_THREAD_ALIVE: thread is alive 
GET_THREAD_EXTRA_INFO
SET_CONTINUE_THREAD : I dont know if this works. it just replies with target !=nullptr
SET_QUERY_THREAD : same as SET_CONTINUE_THREAD

GET_AUXV
GET_MEM: reads 'len' at 'addr' into Vec<u8>. Then "replace_breakpoints_with_original_values" in that memory
SET_MEM: only right to diversion session, writes 'data' at 'addr'

SEARCH_MEM: I think this searches memory for a matching pattern and returns a void*. 
GET_REG: gets value from a register
GET_REGS : gets values from registers


SET_REG : ignore if ORIG_EAX

GET_STOP_REASON : 
SET_SW_BREAK: need to look into this further
SET_RDWR_WATCH:
